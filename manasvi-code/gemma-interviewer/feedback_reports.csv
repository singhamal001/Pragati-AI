It sounds like you have a really diverse skillset! What aspects of those projects are you most passionate about, and what kind of challenges have you encountered working with them?



","My projects which are most passionate about is my back-over banking platform called Lomen. It helps us test hypothesis on the basis of our own bank data such as demographic data, campaign data, bureau data, transaction data and everything about the customer. tomorrow we can run models on the basis of them and feed them into a generated platform on the basis of which the user can ask us queries and take them on and run hypothesis such as on the basis of the campaign data that I have.

But we can do anything, we can take SQL, we can take Azure data, anything and the types of models that I am working with for the application layer, it is the generated AI model such as open AI to for the conversation layer and for the modeling that is for example if I have to run across the model that the customer will buy a credit card or not what the I thought And as I use basic machine learning more.",121,7,"The user's response is somewhat vague and lacks specific details about the models and data, hindering a comprehensive analysis.",1,"The user mentions ""open AI"" and ""basic machine learning"", but misses key terms like ""classification models"", ""regression models"", or specific data types like ""transaction data"", ""customer data"", or ""historical data"".",8,"The user's response is generally professional, but contains some grammatical errors (""we can do anything"", ""I thought"") which could be improved."
